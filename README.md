# Customer-Friendly Restaurant Ordering System

A terminal-based Food Ordering System designed to enhance customer experience using Java

## Overview

This project aims to provide a seamless and secure food ordering experience for customers while leveraging simple data structures like Hashmaps and LinkedHashMaps. It fosters a user-friendly and fast interface through terminal interaction.

### Features

- **Secure Access:** Customers are prompted to enter their name and create a personalized password for secure order placement.
- **Ordered Menu Display:** Utilizes LinkedHashMaps to display the menu in an orderly fashion, simplifying the ordering process.
- **Efficient Ordering:** Customers place orders using serial numbers, reducing errors and minimizing manual input.
- **Order Verification:** After selecting items, customers are prompted to confirm their order and make modifications if needed.
- **Secure Session:** Customers re-enter their password to ensure a secure and personalized ordering session.
- **Bill Generation:** Calculates and presents the bill/total amount to be paid before concluding the transaction.
- **Positive Farewell:** Concludes the interaction with a friendly "Have a nice Day!!!" message.

## How It Works

1. **User Authentication:**
    - Customers input their name and create a password to authenticate their session.

2. **Order Placement:**
    - Displays the menu using LinkedHashMap to maintain order.
    - Customers choose items using their respective serial numbers to streamline the ordering process.

3. **Confirmation and Modification:**
    - Customers confirm their order and have an option to add more items if desired.

4. **Session Security:**
    - Re-entry of the password ensures a secure and personalized session.

5. **Bill Generation:**
    - Calculates the total amount to be paid and presents it to the customer.

## Learning Outcomes

This project has been instrumental in enhancing knowledge and skills in OOPS, data structures, and DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms). By leveraging Java's collections and enhancing user interaction through the terminal, it's a practical demonstration of these concepts.

## Future Plans

- **Backend Integration:** Integrate a backend to store orders, allowing for scalability and future app development.
- **UI Expansion:** Develop a user-friendly interface beyond the terminal for a more interactive experience.
- **Enhanced Security:** Implement additional security measures or authentication methods for customer sessions.
- **Feature Enrichment:** Explore more functionalities such as order history, customization options, or loyalty programs.
